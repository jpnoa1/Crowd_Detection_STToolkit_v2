#                          sensorCheckCommunicationAvailable.py
#
#   This script is responsible for automatically detecting the communication technologies 
#   available and the upload and detection interfaces on the sensor, and inserting/updating
#   that information in the sensor local database.
#
#   It is aimed to run on the sensor boot, so that the sensor can always be aware of the
#   communication technologies and the interfaces for uploading data and for detection.
